* Touches/possession - touches per game, points per touch (PTS per touch) and total touches.
* Passing - passes per game, points created by assist per game, total assists.
* Defensive impact (this stat tracks blocks, steals and "defending the basket" defined as "a defender within 5 feet of the basket and 5 feet of the shooter") - Opposition Field Goal Percentage at the Rim, Opposition Field Goals made at the rim per game, total blocks.
* Rebounding opportunities (rebounds collected "within a 3.5-foot vicinity") - rebound chances per game, percentage of available rebounds grabbed, total rebounds.
* Drives (defined as "any touch that starts at least 20 feet of the hoop and is dribbled within 10 feet of the hoop, excluding fast breaks") - points per game on drives, team points per game on drives, total player points on drives.
* Catch and Shoot (definition: "any jump shot outside of 10 feet where a player possessed the ball for 2 seconds or less and took no dribbles") - catch and shoot points per game, catch and shoot 3-point field goals made per game, total catch and shoot points.
* Pull up shots (definition: "any jump shot outside 10 feet where a player took 1 or more dribbles before shooting") - pull up shots points per game, pull up shots 3-point field goals made per game, total pull up shots points.

The NBA (via Second Spectrum) uses an optical tracking system that leverages multiple cameras placed in the catwalks in all 29 NBA arenas. The cameras receive and update data at a rate of 25 frames per second. The cameras feed the data into proprietary software, where computer vision algorithms extract positional data for all players on the court and the ball.

Player tracking refers to technologies used to track players and the ball (if applicable) in various sports. The National Basketball Association (NBA) first tracked all games at the start of the 2013-14 NBA season.[1] Second Spectrum is the current Official Optical Tracking Provider of the NBA and began league-wide tracking in the 2017-18 NBA season, replacing STATS SportVU which previously held the league-wide contract.[2]

The foundations of MLB tracking data were laid in 2008, when Major League Baseball first installed pitch tracking hardware in every Major League stadium. That step unlocked a new age of baseball fandom, and Statcast builds upon that innovation by measuring everything the previous system did, along with a great deal more. Statcast was installed in all 30 MLB ballparks in 2015 after a partial trial run in 2014.
From 2015-19, Statcast consisted of a combination of camera and radar systems. That changed in 2020, with the arrival of Hawk-Eye. A high-speed camera system previously known for powering the instant replay system in professional tennis, among other things, Hawk-Eye offers increased tracking ability as well as a host of exciting new features, such as better biomechanical tracking of players and, as of 2024, bat tracking data like hitters' swing speeds and swing paths.
Each club now has 12 Hawk-Eye cameras arrayed around its ballpark. Five of those are high-frame-rate cameras -- which were upgraded from 100 frames per second to 300 fps in 2023 -- that focus on bat tracking and pitch tracking. The other seven are dedicated to tracking players and batted balls. This more robust system has raised the percentage of batted balls that get tracked from roughly 89% to 99%.

Player Tracking: Every NBA arena has six cameras that sit high above the court and track every movement of the players on the court and the ball 25 times per second. This information is used to provide new stats based around speed, distance, player separation and ball possession. Stats like how many times a player touched the ball, how fast each player is moving and how many passes each team threw in a game.

At the highest level, the tracking process has several layers. Here's how Djavadzadeh describes the repetition of recording stats throughout an NBA game:
1. A play/tracked event occurs on the court.
2. A courtside "caller" alerts a "primary" person who inputs basic stats.
3. The primary logs a basic stat, while a "secondary" notes descriptive characteristics, such as location on the floor.
4. One or two "tertiaries" then watch a slightly delayed recording of the play to confirm or correct the stats entered.
5. After that, a crew in the league's Seacaucus, NJ, headquarters double-checks and corrects stats. They can discuss corrections with the courtside team. If both teams agree on a correction, it is made, and if they disagree, no change is made at first. Either way, those communications are logged and then again checked by a "Kirk" (another auditor). 



Where can the NBA improve its process? Djavadzadeh believes the league could better utilize its tracking abilities to more accurately portray shot location data by automating that part of a process versus relying on human judgement. While such automation is harder to achieve with most box-score stats, he says, shot location tracking tech already exists and is more plain to understand.
